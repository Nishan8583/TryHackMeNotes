1. install metasploit https://securityonline.info/install-metasploit-on-ubuntu-linux-mint/
2. msdb init # to initialize database
3. backend uses postgres
4. msfconsle > db_status # command inside metasploit gives db status
5. ?/help command
6. search "string to search"
7. use # to activate the module
8. info # after selecting to get information aobut it
9. db_nmap -sV <IP>  # nmap scans, nmap should be preinstalled obviously
10. hosts # check info about the scanned host in the database
11. services # check what services are running from scanned hosts stored in db
12. search "multi/handler"  # the column "#" has number which u can directly use
ex: use 6
13. use multi/hanlder  # to handle the connection we get from exploited server, ex: meterpreter for different stuff, to set options, and use exploit for different
14. post exploitation commands
	- getuid # get user info
	- migrate # to migrate to another process
	- sysinfo # get system info
	- load kiwi# load module, here mimikatz
	- getprivs # check privlize
	- upload, run # upload files, run runs msf module
	- run post/windows/gather/checkvm  # to check if vm
	- run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester  # suggests exlpoit
	- run post/windows/manage/enable_rdp  # to enable rdp
	- shell  # to spwan shell
	- run autorun -h  # see help to shift to another process
	- auxiliary/server/socks4a  # for some stuff

. vulns # to list all the vulnerabilities regarding the host	


# connect > to check if we can communicate with this host
# getg and setg gets and sets global variable accordingly
# get gets insgle global variable
# unset sets to null or zero
# spool command to save the commands 
# save to save the current configs and variables

Modules
1. exlpoit= holds the exploit
2. payload = shellcode, used with exploit to execute code
3. auxiliary = for scanning
4. post = for post exploitation obviously
5. encoder = for payload obfuscation
6. load = to load modules, cause not every modules is loaded by default
